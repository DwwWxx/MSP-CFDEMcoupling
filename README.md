## Description

This code provides new framework and solvers for multi-scale model to realize coupled CFD-DEM simulations using LIGGGHTS® and OpenFOAM® technology.

## List of new solvers

- mspCfdemSolverIB
- mspCfdemSolverMix
- mspCfdemSolverSemi

## Basic Features

- Multi-scale particle-fluid two phase flow simulation
- All solvers support MPI parallelization for large scale problems
- Convenient implementation of new modules
